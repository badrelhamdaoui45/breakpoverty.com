In France, we use <strong>the rate of students leaving school without any diploma<\/strong> as a measure of reference. This number indicates the number of teenagers older than 15-year-old that have <strong>left the educational system<\/strong> during the year <strong>without a diploma<\/strong> (except middle school certificates).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, <strong>13% of teenagers<\/strong> had withdrawn from school without a diploma, which represents <strong>100\u00a0000 school drop-outs<\/strong> in France.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to prevent school failure?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Given the severity of the phenomenon and to act more effectively,<strong> preventing school failures<\/strong> has become a priority since 2015. This national movement translates <strong>into various measures deployed in every academic establishment<\/strong>: detecting tools and sponsoring, training professionals in the educational field, parental implication in the student\u2019s academic progress, tailored programs based on the student\u2019s needs, reorientation facilitated, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fight against school failure?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once the teenager at risk of dropping out has been detected, a host organization assists him in the elaboration of his project and supports him in his endeavors to facilitate and encourage his <strong>return to school, assure his academic levels is equivalent to the one of his pupils and\/or enable him to find employment<\/strong>.
