			<p>The economic consequences of the ongoing health crisis on the French population are dramatic, with an estimated one million people having fallen below the poverty line in 2020. Thirty percent of people from mid-income households saw their financial situation deteriorate during the first lockdown[1] and despite the partial lifting of the lockdown, the trend has continued with <strong>43% of the working population in France saying they have sustained a drop in income</strong>[2]. The number of people claiming income support (<em>revenu de solidarité</em>) has also increased by 10% in the past year. Whether urban or rural, no region has been spared.</p>
<p>Those worst hit by the crisis include students with part-time jobs, temporary workers, but also entrepreneurs and artisans. According to Manuel Domergue, Director of Studies at the Abbé Pierre foundation, <strong>single-parent families</strong>, and particularly single mothers in occupations threatened by the crisis,<strong> are the new victims of poverty since Covid</strong>[3].</p>
<p>As a result, there is a real sense of insecurity among the French population. <strong>According to a recent survey, the fear of falling below the poverty line</strong> has increased by three percentage points since last year. One in four French people are already limiting their food intake and one in seven are skipping meals. Among the lowest wage earners, these figures increase to 46% and 38% respectively.</p>
<h3>Tough times for the younger generations in particular</h3>
<p>The younger generations have borne the brunt of the economic consequences of the health crisis, with 41% experiencing a decrase in income [4], forcing them to reduce their standard of living. According to non-profit organizations, the crisis has forced many young people to seek food aid and the related service offerings, which was not previously the case.</p>
<p>The crisis has disproportionately affected young people because they are more likely to have insecure jobs and are therefore the first victims of the economic crisis. Furthermore, young people entering the job market for the first time “haven’t accrued the minimum rights to be eligible for the aid provided to victims of the crisis,” explains Lucas Chancel, co‑Director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics.</p>
<p>Besides this general increase in poverty among young people in France, they are also faced with a number of challenges in terms of schooling. With the introduction of remote education, <strong>44% of parents of schoolchildren believe</strong> <strong>their children have fallen behind and 15% expect that they will find it hard to catch up. These percentages increase to 57% and 33% respectively for parents with a qualification lower than the <em>baccalauréat</em></strong>.</p>
<h3>A compromised future?</h3>
<p><strong>The worst consequences are probably still to come</strong>. Some 800,000 jobs have already been cut and many others are threatened. J<strong>ob offers open to young graduates fell by almost 40% in 2020 compared to 2019</strong>[5], which also compromises their professional integration on the job market.</p>
<p>The French population are aware of this, with <strong>81% of those questioned considering that the risk of poverty is even higher for their children than for themselves</strong>[6]. The <em>Observatoire des inégalités</em> (French arm of the European network Inequality Watch) has underlined that the situation is disastrous because the health crisis will exacerbate a phenomenon that has emerged over the past twenty years, namely the impoverishment of large numbers of young people.</p>

<p><strong>Break Poverty’s study on early childhood poverty and food aid</strong>, which surveyed around 100 parents with children aged 0-3 receiving food support, <strong>paints an alarming picture of poverty among young children in France</strong>, its impact on family stress and its exponential rise due to the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<p><strong><br />
The effects of the health crisis on early childhood poverty in France</strong></p>
<p>For many people living in poverty, the health crisis has sent their needs soaring. To date, more than <strong>2 million people have turned to food aid distribution in France</strong><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn1">[1]</a>. While job loss, illness and separation are still the three main reasons behind financial struggles among people receiving food aid, the Covid-19 crisis has also had a huge impact.</p>
<p><strong>Some 17% of people turning to food aid have a dependent child under the age of 3.</strong> At an average income of €839 a month<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24793&amp;action=edit&amp;vcv-gutenberg-editor#_ftn1">[1]</a>, with diapers costing around €87 a month<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn2">[2]</a>, this financial stress will inevitably have an impact on their children’s early years.</p>
<p>The situation is becoming even more critical: 50% of people receiving food aid said they began using it less than a year ago<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref1">[1]</a>. And, even worse,<strong> a third of young parents turned to food aid for the first time in the winter of 2021.</strong> This means that more and more people are becoming dependent on food aid – and two thirds of recipients are frequent visitors to food aid centers, which are only supposed to provide occasional support<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Alarming study results</strong></p>
<p>To dig deeper into the difficulties these young parents are facing, Break Poverty ran a study from March 19-26, 2021, surveying around 100 people receiving food aid with a child aged 0-3. We spoke to these people in food aid centers partnering with the &#8220;Agence du Don en Nature&#8221; (agency for donations in kind), hostels run by SAMU Social (Municipal humanitarian emergency service) in Paris and other nonprofits, including Edumian and Amitié Partage, asking them to answer a questionnaire on paper or online.</p>
<p>The resulting statistics on early childhood poverty in France are alarming, with more than one disadvantaged parent in three saying they have to <strong>limit the number of baby food pots</strong> they give their children for financial reasons<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref3">[3</a>]. And one in five say they often give their young children reduced amounts of baby food<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn4">[4]</a>. When it comes to hygiene products, the situation is even more critical. Some 51% of people receiving food aid say they can’t afford to buy as many <strong>hygiene products, particularly diapers</strong>, for their babies<a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn5">[5]</a> as they’d like to.</p>
<p>That’s even more alarming given the difficulties that food aid centers are having in responding to the sudden surge in needs since the health crisis. Usually, public and private aid and support systems act as a safety net to stop poverty situations getting out of control. But this year, more than <strong>three in four parents receiving support think that the crisis has made it more difficult to get free or heavily subsidized diapers and hygiene products from aid centers</strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref4">[</a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref4">4]</a>. And the same goes for food products: 58% and 63% of parents receiving support say that the crisis has made it harder to get baby formula and baby food pots, respectively, from aid centers<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Even though feeding their children is the last thing parents cut back on, 70% and 67% of them say that <strong>the Covid-19 crisis has had a negative impact on their financial ability to buy baby formula and baby food pots</strong>, respectively, for their children under three<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>And now,after a year of health, economic and social crisis, the results of our survey couldn’t be clearer: <strong>early childhood poverty is very real,</strong> <strong>to the point that basic needs for babies and toddlers are not being sufficiently met</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Taking action to prevent long-term impacts</strong></p>
<p>Eight in ten parents say that they had to ration food with <strong>significant consequences on their children’s wellbeing</strong>, with many reporting that they cry frequently, have trouble sleeping and suffer from skin irritations. It can cause “heightened stress, with consequences on babies’ neurological, emotional, affective, cognitive and relational development,” according to the “1000 premiers jours” (first 1,000 days) commission launched by the French government in September 2019, so named to highlight the importance of the first 1,000 days of life for any individual’s development.</p>
<p>Chaired by neuropsychiatrist Boris Cyrulnik and bringing together 18 specialists in various fields (including social assistants who work directly with parents), this working group is primarily aimed at determining how all children can grow in the best conditions. This means paying special attention to families in poverty, with recommended measures including support to organizations working with pregnant women and young mothers.</p>
<p>Being unable to afford all the products their babies need also takes a toll on parents, with 72% of parents receiving food aid saying that <strong>feeding their baby is a source of stress</strong><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn6">[6]</a>. “More and more parents are telling us about how difficult their day-to-day is,” said Adrien Taquet, French State Secretary for Childhood and Families, who is overseeing the work of the “1000 premiers jours” commission. “We need to work together to do better, for our children and for our society,” he emphasized.</p>
<p>And that’s what operation <a href="https://breakpoverty.com/operation-produits-essentiels-bebes/">SOS infants in need</a> (Urgence Premiers Pas), launched by Break Poverty Foundation and backed by French State Secretary for Childhood and Families, Adrien Taquet, and L’Agence du Don en Nature, is all about. The first years of a child’s life have a huge impact on their future, from brain development to health, happiness, learning capacity and wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Together, we must let children grow – not poverty.</strong></p>

			<p>Digital skills are essential for citizens to be fully integrated in today’s society. Most administrative formalities are carried out online, whether it’s completing a tax return, looking for work or creating a business. But what about those on the other side of the digital divide?</p>
<h3>Digital illiteracy : a cause and a consequence of social exclusion</h3>
<p>Digital illiteracy is a phenomenon that affects the most vulnerable. It is the term used for the inability to use digital tools on a daily basis and <strong>affects 17% of the population, or nearly 13 million people in France,</strong> according to the French national statistics office <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil">INSEE.</a></p>
<p>The main causes are social, regional and generational. For example, <strong>50% of non‑Internet users live in towns with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants and 34% of low‑skilled or unskilled people are affected by the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>In this digital age, <strong>the digital divide and digital illiteracy are deepening existing inequalities and reinforcing the exclusion of those who are already vulnerable, </strong>since they affect 16% of low-income households, but just 4% of the wealthiest households.</p>
<p>Worse still, according to a survey published in November 2018, the digital revolution is seen more as a vector of exclusion than of inclusion (39% versus 18% of respondents, respectively).</p>
<h3>Inequality that deepens in times of crisis</h3>
<p>As the health and social crisis continues to unfold in France, the consequences in terms of digital exclusion and digital illiteracy are devastating.</p>
<p>Remote teaching is becoming increasingly widespread, <strong>but one in four low‑income families lacks the necessary equipment for their children to attend classes from home</strong>. Faced with this situation and in partnership with the AFEV and Bouygues Télécom, Break Poverty has launched <em>Réussite Connectée</em> (Connected to Succeed), a program that aims to provide disadvantaged students with the digital equipment and skills they lack to succeed at school. Our objective is to give each student the same chances of success, irrespective of their social background.</p>

			<p>The young are the first victims of poverty. In France, <strong>a child out of five</strong> lives in precarious environments. In the world, 50% of the children are very poor. If the youth in France suffer notably from their parents’ financial weaknesses – which mostly impacts their education – the <strong>1 billion other poor children</strong> in the world suffer much worse deprivations, sometimes deadly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Youth poverty in France: it&#8217;s an emergency!</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In France, a child out of 19 is born poor</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>3 million children are poor</li>
<li>30 000 children <strong>live on the streets</strong> with their families</li>
<li>19,1% of the 18-year-old or less population lives under the international poverty line</li>
<li>26% of the 30-year-old population is poor</li>
<li>33% of poor children live in <strong>single-parent families</strong></li>
<li>20% of the French have trouble paying for their children’s school canteen</li>
<li>50% of poor families do not go on holidays</li>
<li><strong>6 generations</strong>, that is the time needed for upward social mobility and for a child to overcome poverty</li>
<li>1015€, this is the poverty line in France</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A worsening financial insecurity un the lives of the young</h3>
<p>In UNICEF’s report, <strong><a href="https://www.unicef.org/french/sowc2014/numbers/documents/french/FR-FINAL%20FULL%20REPORT.pdf">Every child counts</a></strong>, published in 2015, they address an alarming statistic about the young population’s situation in France. A reality that has only deteriorated since the economic crisis of 2008. Indeed, 440 000 children would have since dived, with their families, in precarious situations, bringing the number <strong>of poor children in France to 3 million</strong>. This is a major step-back, especially if considering that one must account for 6 generations to overcome poverty!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Will a poor child become a poor adult?</h3>
<p>As the <strong><a href="https://www.inegalites.fr/1-2-million-d-enfants-de-pauvres?id_theme=21">Observatory of inequalities</a></strong> underlines, rather than speaking about poor children, it is important to speak about children from poor parents, more often children whose parents do not have employment or low-wage jobs. Thus, the restrictions poor families endure are a major burden for their children. Living in a poor family constitutes one of <strong>the components that reproduce inequalities</strong>, main causes for <strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/en/programs/areas-of-intervention/prevention-of-school-dropout/">school dropouts</a></strong> and the difficulties for <strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/en/programs/areas-of-intervention/access-to-first-employment/">young adults to find employment.</a></strong></p>
<p>In the OCED’s study, <strong><a href="http://www.oecd.org/social/broken-elevator-how-to-promote-social-mobility-9789264301085-en.htm">A broken social elevator?</a></strong>, highlights the extent to which <strong>educational mobility is blocked in France</strong>. According to this international organization, 6 generations would be needed to attain an average French income for children born in poor families. A social reproduction in the professional world (the children from wealthy families remain wealthy, the children from underprivileged families remain underprivileged) happens just as often in the educational world. Thus, only 17% of children from underprivileged families who did not further higher studies have access to universities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In the world, half of the poor are children</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Facts and numbers on poor children in the world</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>2 billion children are poor</li>
<li>385 million children are extremely poor*</li>
<li>120 million children live on the streets in the world</li>
<li>90 million children suffer from grave malnutrition</li>
<li>2,6 million infants die every year, notably in Africa</li>
<li>4 children extremely poor out of 5 live in rural areas</li>
<li>10% of children work, of which half live in dangerous conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When poverty leads to children mortality</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.unicef.org/french/publications/files/UNICEF_SOWC_2016_French_LAST.pdf">UNICEF’s report</a> </strong>on children’s situation in the world in 2016 was quite straightforward: if nothing is urgently done, <strong>69 million children less than 5 years old </strong>will die between 2016 and 2030. The cause? The extreme poverty that restricts these children from potable water and the adequate nutrition. Most of these deaths are linked to diseases that could have easily been avoided or cured. Indeed, 1,4 million children die from diarrhea and pneumonia every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">60 million children are still not in the educational system</h3>
<p>Certainly, the 1 billion poor children are not all victims of food insecurity. However, they are concerned with other important restrictions, in particular the difficulty to access education. Thus, 13% of children aged from 7 to 18 years old have never been to school (a rate that goes up to 16% for girls) and 60 million children who were of age to go to primary school were still out of school in 2015. Again, Sub-Saharan Africa is, by far, the most concerned zone. According to <strong><a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000232565_fre">UNESCO’s world report monitoring Education in 2015</a></strong>, the percentage of children in secondary school is 92% in rich countries, while it is only 33% in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, South and West Asia struggle to reach the world average. The authors of the report point out: “the poorest children are four times less likely to access school than the richest children and the probability that they do not finish primary school is five times higher.”</p>
<p>An important issue – still according to the UNESCO – as<strong> poverty rates could be divided by two</strong> if all students finished their secondary school education!</p>

<p>Every year, 100 000 teenagers leave school without a diploma. Despite the improvement in the past 10 years, much has yet to be done; especially when looking at a school’s role in providing <strong>equal opportunities</strong> to all. For this reason, the Break Poverty Foundation has launched an <strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/en/programs/areas-of-intervention/prevention-of-school-dropout/">ambitious program aiming to prevent school-drop</a> outs</strong>. However, what is the scale of this phenomena? What solutions can we support to restore equal opportunities for all children?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">School drop-outs and social inequalities in numbers</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>13% of students drop-out </strong>every year from school</li>
<li>In other words,<strong> 100 000 young adults</strong> per year</li>
<li><strong>450 000 young adults</strong> from 18 to 24 years old have not graduated and have not followed any type of training in the past four weeks</li>
<li><strong>230 000 euros: </strong>amount of money a high-school dropout costs to the community</li>
<li><strong>38,4%</strong> of the children who have a mother who never graduated will also drop-out, versus 5,9% of children who have a mother with a diploma from graduate school</li>
<li><strong>28% </strong>of the children coming from a working-class family drop-out from high school versus<strong> 7% </strong>of children who come from a wealthy family</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;our priority is prevention&#8221;</h2>



<p>Three questions for Christophe Sanchez, director of programs at Break Poverty Foundation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why prioritize school drop-ouys as one of your three pillars to combat poverty?</h3>



<p>There are many reasons why we made this decision. First of all, because we know that school is still the best way to overcome poverty. According to <strong><a href="https://www.strategie.gouv.fr">France Stratégie</a></strong>, the revenue of a person is determined by the level of their diploma by 50%. Did you know that a young adult who has dropped out of school has a chance out of two to be unemployed three years after leaving school? In other words, there are still 100 000 students who – every year – leave school with no diploma. Although there have been some improvements, the situation remains too precarious and thus must be a priority.</p>



<p>Beyond our desire to combat this social determinism, we also have a very pragmatic approach: a person who drops out of school costs 230 000 euros to the community.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is abandoning school a new phenomenon?</h3>



<p>No, there has always been school drop-outs. However, this topic becomes more delicate in periods of acute crisis. During the Glorious Thirty, in the time of high productivity, we could find work without a diploma. Today, <strong>to not have the required qualifications is a synonym for unemployment or unstable employment</strong>. Thus, 80% of the people having a diploma inferior to a high school diploma are recruited with fixed-term employment contracts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you take action to overcome the phenomenon of schools drop-outs?</h3>



<p>Our priority is prevention. Why? Because the risks of dropping out of school emerge in the first grade. A drop-out student generally follows the same cycle: in primary, he encounters many difficulties, in middle school his difficulties become more acute and behavioral problems emerge. In high school, it is his lack of motivation and amount of absences that lead to his drop-out. This finding allows us to discern the children who are at risk of abandoning school and to act more effectively and quickly. Our mission is thus to <strong>curb the first difficulties </strong>a child is faced with in order to keep him on the right track. Academic support, development of adapted teaching tools, partnerships with schools/parents/associations… from the youngest age, we must prevent academic difficulties to give every child the taste of learning!</p>



<p>Apart from this preventive work, we think it is essential to understand the child’s aspirations to ensure that he can benefit from the most pertinent orientation, tailored to his desires and needs. How? By <strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/en/mandate/#innovation">financing associations</a></strong> that lead innovative and efficient projects, which can be replicated on other territories to prevent school drop-outs. One of our convictions is that enterprises have an essential role to play in their capacity to offer a future to young adults in difficulty. We have also launched a “<strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/en/programs/the-local-endowment-fund-against-poverty/">Local Endowment Fund Against Poverty</a></strong>” strategy. The aim? Create a bridge between enterprises and transformative projects. In this context, we support the promising project of the Escalades enterprises association in Nantes <em>(read zoom further down)</em> which helps young adults to discover their aspirations by opening the doors to the world of enterprises.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> </h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FOCUS on one our pioneer projectsEscalades enterprises, to combat school drop-outs from every angle!</strong></h2>



<p>Made up of nearly 150 enterprise managers from the Nantes region, the association <strong><a href="https://escalade-entreprises.net">Escalade enterprises</a></strong> experiments with an original tool to combat school drop-outs. Their actions are based on two pillars: prevent school drop-outs by accompanying teenagers with an aim to bring them back into school and to bring them closer to enterprises and the, notably by showing them different career paths.</p>



<p>Results: Thanks to the project <em>JEM (Jeunes Envie Motivation) </em>(Youth Want Motivation) – a 3-month course combining self-work, discovery of a potential career path, and the creation of a personal project – 50% of the 130 teenagers aged 14 to 15 who followed this course went back to school afterwards.</p>



<p>More broadly, Escalade enterprises takes the time to meet young people through presentation sessions on careers by going to schools and by welcoming students into their own establishments.</p>



<p>Result: thousands of young people have changed their views on the world of enterprises! To be continued…</p>
