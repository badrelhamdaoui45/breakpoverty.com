			<p>The economic consequences of the ongoing health crisis on the French population are dramatic, with an estimated one million people having fallen below the poverty line in 2020. Thirty percent of people from mid-income households saw their financial situation deteriorate during the first lockdown[1] and despite the partial lifting of the lockdown, the trend has continued with <strong>43% of the working population in France saying they have sustained a drop in income</strong>[2]. The number of people claiming income support (<em>revenu de solidarité</em>) has also increased by 10% in the past year. Whether urban or rural, no region has been spared.</p>
<p>Those worst hit by the crisis include students with part-time jobs, temporary workers, but also entrepreneurs and artisans. According to Manuel Domergue, Director of Studies at the Abbé Pierre foundation, <strong>single-parent families</strong>, and particularly single mothers in occupations threatened by the crisis,<strong> are the new victims of poverty since Covid</strong>[3].</p>
<p>As a result, there is a real sense of insecurity among the French population. <strong>According to a recent survey, the fear of falling below the poverty line</strong> has increased by three percentage points since last year. One in four French people are already limiting their food intake and one in seven are skipping meals. Among the lowest wage earners, these figures increase to 46% and 38% respectively.</p>
<h3>Tough times for the younger generations in particular</h3>
<p>The younger generations have borne the brunt of the economic consequences of the health crisis, with 41% experiencing a decrase in income [4], forcing them to reduce their standard of living. According to non-profit organizations, the crisis has forced many young people to seek food aid and the related service offerings, which was not previously the case.</p>
<p>The crisis has disproportionately affected young people because they are more likely to have insecure jobs and are therefore the first victims of the economic crisis. Furthermore, young people entering the job market for the first time “haven’t accrued the minimum rights to be eligible for the aid provided to victims of the crisis,” explains Lucas Chancel, co‑Director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics.</p>
<p>Besides this general increase in poverty among young people in France, they are also faced with a number of challenges in terms of schooling. With the introduction of remote education, <strong>44% of parents of schoolchildren believe</strong> <strong>their children have fallen behind and 15% expect that they will find it hard to catch up. These percentages increase to 57% and 33% respectively for parents with a qualification lower than the <em>baccalauréat</em></strong>.</p>
<h3>A compromised future?</h3>
<p><strong>The worst consequences are probably still to come</strong>. Some 800,000 jobs have already been cut and many others are threatened. J<strong>ob offers open to young graduates fell by almost 40% in 2020 compared to 2019</strong>[5], which also compromises their professional integration on the job market.</p>
<p>The French population are aware of this, with <strong>81% of those questioned considering that the risk of poverty is even higher for their children than for themselves</strong>[6]. The <em>Observatoire des inégalités</em> (French arm of the European network Inequality Watch) has underlined that the situation is disastrous because the health crisis will exacerbate a phenomenon that has emerged over the past twenty years, namely the impoverishment of large numbers of young people.</p>

<p><strong>Break Poverty’s study on early childhood poverty and food aid</strong>, which surveyed around 100 parents with children aged 0-3 receiving food support, <strong>paints an alarming picture of poverty among young children in France</strong>, its impact on family stress and its exponential rise due to the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<p><strong><br />
The effects of the health crisis on early childhood poverty in France</strong></p>
<p>For many people living in poverty, the health crisis has sent their needs soaring. To date, more than <strong>2 million people have turned to food aid distribution in France</strong><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn1">[1]</a>. While job loss, illness and separation are still the three main reasons behind financial struggles among people receiving food aid, the Covid-19 crisis has also had a huge impact.</p>
<p><strong>Some 17% of people turning to food aid have a dependent child under the age of 3.</strong> At an average income of €839 a month<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24793&amp;action=edit&amp;vcv-gutenberg-editor#_ftn1">[1]</a>, with diapers costing around €87 a month<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn2">[2]</a>, this financial stress will inevitably have an impact on their children’s early years.</p>
<p>The situation is becoming even more critical: 50% of people receiving food aid said they began using it less than a year ago<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref1">[1]</a>. And, even worse,<strong> a third of young parents turned to food aid for the first time in the winter of 2021.</strong> This means that more and more people are becoming dependent on food aid – and two thirds of recipients are frequent visitors to food aid centers, which are only supposed to provide occasional support<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Alarming study results</strong></p>
<p>To dig deeper into the difficulties these young parents are facing, Break Poverty ran a study from March 19-26, 2021, surveying around 100 people receiving food aid with a child aged 0-3. We spoke to these people in food aid centers partnering with the &#8220;Agence du Don en Nature&#8221; (agency for donations in kind), hostels run by SAMU Social (Municipal humanitarian emergency service) in Paris and other nonprofits, including Edumian and Amitié Partage, asking them to answer a questionnaire on paper or online.</p>
<p>The resulting statistics on early childhood poverty in France are alarming, with more than one disadvantaged parent in three saying they have to <strong>limit the number of baby food pots</strong> they give their children for financial reasons<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref3">[3</a>]. And one in five say they often give their young children reduced amounts of baby food<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn4">[4]</a>. When it comes to hygiene products, the situation is even more critical. Some 51% of people receiving food aid say they can’t afford to buy as many <strong>hygiene products, particularly diapers</strong>, for their babies<a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn5">[5]</a> as they’d like to.</p>
<p>That’s even more alarming given the difficulties that food aid centers are having in responding to the sudden surge in needs since the health crisis. Usually, public and private aid and support systems act as a safety net to stop poverty situations getting out of control. But this year, more than <strong>three in four parents receiving support think that the crisis has made it more difficult to get free or heavily subsidized diapers and hygiene products from aid centers</strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref4">[</a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref4">4]</a>. And the same goes for food products: 58% and 63% of parents receiving support say that the crisis has made it harder to get baby formula and baby food pots, respectively, from aid centers<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Even though feeding their children is the last thing parents cut back on, 70% and 67% of them say that <strong>the Covid-19 crisis has had a negative impact on their financial ability to buy baby formula and baby food pots</strong>, respectively, for their children under three<a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>And now,after a year of health, economic and social crisis, the results of our survey couldn’t be clearer: <strong>early childhood poverty is very real,</strong> <strong>to the point that basic needs for babies and toddlers are not being sufficiently met</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Taking action to prevent long-term impacts</strong></p>
<p>Eight in ten parents say that they had to ration food with <strong>significant consequences on their children’s wellbeing</strong>, with many reporting that they cry frequently, have trouble sleeping and suffer from skin irritations. It can cause “heightened stress, with consequences on babies’ neurological, emotional, affective, cognitive and relational development,” according to the “1000 premiers jours” (first 1,000 days) commission launched by the French government in September 2019, so named to highlight the importance of the first 1,000 days of life for any individual’s development.</p>
<p>Chaired by neuropsychiatrist Boris Cyrulnik and bringing together 18 specialists in various fields (including social assistants who work directly with parents), this working group is primarily aimed at determining how all children can grow in the best conditions. This means paying special attention to families in poverty, with recommended measures including support to organizations working with pregnant women and young mothers.</p>
<p>Being unable to afford all the products their babies need also takes a toll on parents, with 72% of parents receiving food aid saying that <strong>feeding their baby is a source of stress</strong><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/enquete-precarite-infantile-crise/#_ftn6">[6]</a>. “More and more parents are telling us about how difficult their day-to-day is,” said Adrien Taquet, French State Secretary for Childhood and Families, who is overseeing the work of the “1000 premiers jours” commission. “We need to work together to do better, for our children and for our society,” he emphasized.</p>
<p>And that’s what operation <a href="https://breakpoverty.com/operation-produits-essentiels-bebes/">SOS infants in need</a> (Urgence Premiers Pas), launched by Break Poverty Foundation and backed by French State Secretary for Childhood and Families, Adrien Taquet, and L’Agence du Don en Nature, is all about. The first years of a child’s life have a huge impact on their future, from brain development to health, happiness, learning capacity and wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Together, we must let children grow – not poverty.</strong></p>

			<p>Digital skills are essential for citizens to be fully integrated in today’s society. Most administrative formalities are carried out online, whether it’s completing a tax return, looking for work or creating a business. But what about those on the other side of the digital divide?</p>
<h3>Digital illiteracy : a cause and a consequence of social exclusion</h3>
<p>Digital illiteracy is a phenomenon that affects the most vulnerable. It is the term used for the inability to use digital tools on a daily basis and <strong>affects 17% of the population, or nearly 13 million people in France,</strong> according to the French national statistics office <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil">INSEE.</a></p>
<p>The main causes are social, regional and generational. For example, <strong>50% of non‑Internet users live in towns with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants and 34% of low‑skilled or unskilled people are affected by the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>In this digital age, <strong>the digital divide and digital illiteracy are deepening existing inequalities and reinforcing the exclusion of those who are already vulnerable, </strong>since they affect 16% of low-income households, but just 4% of the wealthiest households.</p>
<p>Worse still, according to a survey published in November 2018, the digital revolution is seen more as a vector of exclusion than of inclusion (39% versus 18% of respondents, respectively).</p>
<h3>Inequality that deepens in times of crisis</h3>
<p>As the health and social crisis continues to unfold in France, the consequences in terms of digital exclusion and digital illiteracy are devastating.</p>
<p>Remote teaching is becoming increasingly widespread, <strong>but one in four low‑income families lacks the necessary equipment for their children to attend classes from home</strong>. Faced with this situation and in partnership with the AFEV and Bouygues Télécom, Break Poverty has launched <em>Réussite Connectée</em> (Connected to Succeed), a program that aims to provide disadvantaged students with the digital equipment and skills they lack to succeed at school. Our objective is to give each student the same chances of success, irrespective of their social background.</p>

<p>Although Break Poverty intervenes primordially in France today through its three pillars of intervention: <strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/en/programs/areas-of-intervention/support-during-early-childhood/">early childhood</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/en/programs/areas-of-intervention/prevention-of-school-dropout/">prevention of school drop-outs</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://breakpoverty.com/en/programs/areas-of-intervention/access-to-first-employment/">access to employment</a></strong>, Break Poverty is determined to continue its battle against poverty all around the world, especially where extreme poverty remains a violent threat to populations. <strong>A first and extensive program is currently developing in India.</strong> Multiple projects are currently being examined in other regions of the world such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Health and malnutrition</strong>: care for children suffering severe malnutrition, for pregnant women, awareness of breastfeeding …</li>
<li><strong>Development of rationing tools</strong>: set up of familial gardens, distribution of seeds, training for farmers, cooking classes, informing families on the constituents of a balanced meal …</li>
<li><strong>Water and hygiene</strong>: installation and rehabilitation for drinkable water sources and informing residents the adequate sanitary practices when utilizing toilets.</li>
</ul>



<p>Repair the needs, mobilize local players – in particular enterprises – set up pioneer and innovative projects, in order <strong>to measure the impacts</strong> and to replicate it in other regions. This project will soon be evaluated and spread somewhere where the needs are great.</p>
